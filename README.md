# CO2 Emissions Prediction
This repository contains the Streamlit app and Jupyter Notebook for predicting COâ‚‚ emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs).

Key Features:
- Machine learning models (Random Forest, Polynomial Ridge, and others) for COâ‚‚ predictions
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
- Interactive Streamlit web app for real-time predictions
- Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and residual analysis
- Trained model files and deployment-ready code

ðŸ“‚ Includes:
- `co2_prediction.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with full data analysis and model training
- `co2_pred.py` â†’ Streamlit app code for real-time predictions
- `random_forest_compressed.pkl` â†’ compressed trained model for deployment
- `feature_columns.pkl` â†’ Saved feature list for consistent input processing
- `data/sample_data.csv` â†’ Sample input data for predictions.
- `data/sample_CO2.csv` â†’ Sample COâ‚‚ emissions data.
- `data/actual_rf.csv` â†’ Actual COâ‚‚ emissions values for distribution plot.
- `data/predicted_rf.csv` â†’ Prediction COâ‚‚ emissions values for distribution plot.
- `data/residuals_rf.csv` â†’ Model Residuals for calculating 95% confidence intervals.
