# CO2_Emissions_Prediction
This repository contains the Streamlit app and Jupyter Notebook for predicting COâ‚‚ emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs).

Key Features:
âœ” Machine learning models (Random Forest, SVR, and others) for COâ‚‚ predictions
âœ” Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
âœ” Interactive Streamlit web app for real-time predictions
âœ” Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and residual analysis
âœ” Trained model files and deployment-ready code

ðŸ“‚ Includes:
	â€¢	co2_prediction.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook with full data analysis and model training
	â€¢	app.py â†’ Streamlit app code for real-time predictions
	â€¢	random_forest_co2.pkl â†’ Trained model for deployment
	â€¢	feature_columns.pkl â†’ Saved feature list for consistent input processing

ðŸ“¢ Check out the app and share your feedback! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
